🧭 Sales Performance Analysis Project
🎯 Goal

Analyze sales performance to identify:

The most profitable products and categories

The best and worst performing regions

The top-performing salespeople

Actionable strategies to increase revenue

Example Company: A retail or e-commerce business selling multiple products across different regions.

🪜 Step 1: Project Roadmap

1. Project Planning

Define key objectives:

Find top-performing products and categories

Identify underperforming regions

Analyze monthly revenue trends

Evaluate sales team performance

2. Data Collection

We’ll use one of the following datasets (in CSV format):

📂 Kaggle: “Superstore Sales Dataset”

📂 GitHub: “Retail Sales Data”

📂 Google Dataset Search: “Sales Transactions”

Once the project plan is finalized, we’ll pick and download one dataset.

3. Data Cleaning

Tasks:

Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Fix data types (e.g., convert Order Date → datetime)

Rename columns for clarity

Correct negative or zero values if illogical

4. Data Exploration (EDA)

Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):

View dataset summary with .describe() and .info()

Visualize sales by category, region, and month

Analyze profit vs. discount relationships

5. Data Modeling

You’ll create:

New columns: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Discount

Aggregations: Group data by Region, Category, or Salesperson

Trend analysis: Compare monthly or yearly results

6. Data Analysis & Insights

Key questions to answer:

Which product category yields the highest profit?

Which region or city has the best sales performance?

How do discounts affect profit margins?

Who is the top salesperson?

What are the top 5 most profitable products?

7. Visualization

Create visual insights using:

Chart Type Purpose
📊 Bar Chart Top products by profit
📈 Line Chart Monthly revenue trends
🥧 Pie Chart Category-wise sales share
🌡️ Heatmap Correlation between sales metrics 8. Reporting

Deliverables:

A short report (PowerPoint or PDF) summarizing insights
