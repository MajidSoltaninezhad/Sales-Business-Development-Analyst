🪜 Step 1: Roadmap for Sales Project

1. Project Planning
   Define key objectives:

Find top-performing products and categories

Identify underperforming regions

Analyze monthly revenue trends

Evaluate sales team performance

2. Data Collection
   We’ll use one of these datasets:
   📂 Kaggle: “Superstore Sales Dataset”

📂 GitHub: “Retail Sales Data”

📂 Google Dataset Search: “Sales Transactions”

➡️ I’ll help you pick and download one (CSV format) once we confirm the project plan.

3. Data Cleaning
   Tasks you’ll do:
   Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Correct wrong data types (e.g. Date → datetime)

Rename columns for readability

Fix negative or zero values if not logical

4. Data Exploration (EDA)
   Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to:
   Describe the data (.describe(), .info())

Plot sales by category, region, or month

Check relationships (e.g., profit vs discount)

5. Data Modeling
   You’ll create:
   Total sales, total profit, average discount columns

Group data by region, category, or salesperson

Compare monthly or yearly trends

6. Data Analysis & Insights
   Answer business questions like:
   Which product category brings the highest profit?

Which region or city performs best in sales?

How do discounts affect profit margin?

Which salesperson has the best performance?

What are the top 5 most profitable products?

7. Visualization
   Use charts:
   Bar chart → Top products

Line chart → Monthly revenue trend

Pie chart → Category share

Heatmap → Correlation between variables

8. Reporting
   You’ll summarize your results and create:
   A short report in PowerPoint or PDF

Optional: Interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
